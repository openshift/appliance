# OpenShift-based Appliance Builder

`openshift-appliance` is a command line utility for building a disk image that orchestrates OpenShift installation using the [Agent-based installer](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/meet-the-new-agent-based-openshift-installer-1).
The primary use-case of the appliance is to support a fully disconnected installation
of an OpenShift cluster. Thus, all required images are included in the appliance disk image.

***Note: this README is intended for developers, usage details are available in the [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)***

## Quick Start

### Build (binary or container image)

#### Build binary

##### Install dependencies

* libguestfs-tools
* coreos-installer
* oc
* oc-mirror
* skopeo
* podman
* go >= 1.19

Note: for oc-mirror usage, the builder ensures that the pull secret exists at `~/.docker/config.json`

##### Build

``` bash
make build-appliance
```

#### Build container image

``` bash
export IMAGE=<image_url>

make build
```

### Run

#### Commands
* build
* clean
* generate-config

#### Flags
* --dir
* --log-level

#### Create config file (appliance-config.yaml)

##### Generate config file template

Using binary:
``` bash
./build/openshift-appliance generate-config --dir assets
```

Using container image:
``` bash
export IMAGE=<image_url>
export CMD=generate-config
export ASSETS=<assets-absolute-dir-path>

make run
```

##### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: ApplianceConfig
ocpRelease:
  version: 4.19
  channel: stable
  cpuArchitecture: x86_64
diskSizeGB: 200
imageRegistry:
  uri: docker.io/library/registry:2
pullSecret: '...'
```

Notes:
* `imageRegistry` is mandatory when using the binary.
* For more details, see [Appliance user-guide](docs/user-guide.md#set-appliance-config).

#### Start appliance disk image build flow

Using binary:
``` bash
export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct

./build/openshift-appliance build --dir assets --log-level info
```

Using container image:
``` bash
export IMAGE=<image_url>
export CMD=build
export ASSETS=<assets-absolute-dir-path>
export LOG_LEVEL=info/debug/error

make run
```

##### Cleanup

After a successful build, use the `clean` command before re-building the appliance (removes temp folder and state file).

## Development

### Running tests
```bash
skipper make test
```

### Running lint
```bash
skipper make lint
```

### Debug

#### Bootstrap step

Add `--debug-bootstrap` flag to the build command to avoid machine reboot on bootstrap step completion. Useful for taking a snapshot of the appliance disk image before testing changes in the install ignition. 

#### unconfigured-ignition API

Add `--debug-base-ignition` flag to the build command for using a custom openshift-install binary to invoke `agent create unconfigured-ignition`.
Use these [instructions](https://github.com/openshift/installer#quick-start) to build the openshift-install binary, and copy it into `assets` dir.

#### Test changes in the install ignition

To debug/test changes made in the `InstallIgnition` asset, follow the steps described on [test_install_ignition.md](/hack/diskimage/test_install_ignition.md)

## Main Components

### Recovery ISO Assets (pkg/asset/recovery/)
* BaseISO - a CoreOS LiveCD used as a base for the recovery ISO
* RecoveryISO - the base ISO with an embedded recovery ignition

### Appliance Assets (pkg/asset/appliance/)
* BaseDiskImage - a CoreOS raw disk image used as a base for the appliance disk image
* ApplianceDiskImage - the output disk image of the builder

### Ignition Assets (pkg/asset/ignition/)
* BootstrapIgnition - the ignition config used for cluster bootstrap step
* InstallIgnition - the ignition config used for cluster installation step
* RecoveryIgnition - the ignition config embedded into the recovery ISO

## High-Level Flow

The appliance build process consists of the following steps:
1. Download CoreOS ISO
   * Extracted from the `machine-os-images` image (included in the release payload)
   * Used as the base image of the recovery ISO
2. Generate recovery CoreOS ISO
   * Generated by embedding a custom bootstrap ignition to the base CoreOS ISO
   * Used as the `recovery` partition (labeled 'agentboot') of the appliance disk image
3. Pull registry image
   * Used for serving the OCP release images on bootstrap and installation steps
4. Pull release images required for bootstrap
   * Only a subset of the entire release payload (i.e. images that are required for bootstrap)
5. Pull release images required for installation
   * Includes the entire release payload
6. Generate data ISO
   * Includes the registry and release images that are pulled in previous steps
   * Used as the 'data partition' of the appliance disk image
7. Download appliance base disk image
   * A qcow2 image of CoreOS
   * Used as the base disk image of the appliance
8. Generate appliance disk image
   * Contains the following:
     * An ignition for orchestrating the OpenShift cluster installation 
     * A recovery partition for reinstalling if necessary
     * The full OCP release payload for supporting disconnected environments

#### Appliance disk image structure

``` bash
$ virt-filesystems -a assets/appliance.raw -l -h
Name       Type        VFS      Label       Size  Parent
/dev/sda2  filesystem  vfat     EFI-SYSTEM  127M  -
/dev/sda3  filesystem  ext4     boot        350M  -
/dev/sda4  filesystem  xfs      root        180G  -
/dev/sda5  filesystem  iso9660  agentboot   1.2G  -
/dev/sda6  filesystem  iso9660  agentdata   18G   -
```

## Configuration ISO

After booting a machine with appliance.raw disk image, the appliance looks for `/media/config-image` that should contain specific user values for cluster creation.

The config image is generated by invoking the following command:
```bash
$ openshift-install agent create config-image --dir assets
```

The `assets` directory should include `install-config.yaml` and `agent-config.yaml` files. 
For full details about the supported properties and examples, refer to:
* [Appliance user-guide](docs/user-guide.md#generate-a-cluster-configuration-image)
* [Agent-based Installer docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.17/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer.html#installation-bare-metal-agent-installer-config-yaml_preparing-to-install-with-agent-based-installer)
* [Installer user-guide](https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/customization.md)

The command outputs the following:
* A non-bootable configuration ISO ( agentconfig.noarch.iso)
* 'auth' directory: contains `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password`
